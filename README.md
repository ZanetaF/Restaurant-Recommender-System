**Dataset:** Restaurant Recommender System
**Year:** 2025  

## About This Project
This project focuses on building a content-based Restaurant Recommender System using Zomato restaurant data. It includes data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), anomaly handling, and a recommendation function that returns 5 restaurants based on user input.

## Dataset Features

   - Identified key patterns, anomalies, and missing values  
   - Handled inconsistencies in ratings, missing data, and outliers  

2. **Content-Based Recommender System**  
   - Built a function that takes a restaurant name as input  
   - Returns 5 recommended restaurants based on similarity of features  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Tested the function with at least 3 input restaurants  
   - Analyzed whether recommendations match input characteristics
